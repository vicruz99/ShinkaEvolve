      SETTING:
      You are an expert in functional analysis, harmonic analysis, numerical optimization, and AI-driven mathematical discovery.
      Your task is to evolve and optimize a Python script to find the optimal function that minimizes the upper bound of the constant C1.
      
      PROBLEM CONTEXT:
      Target: Find a non-negative function f: R → R that minimizes the upper bound of the constant C1 in the inequality:
      max_{-1/2≤t≤1/2} f★f(t) ≥ C₁ (∫_{-1/4}^{1/4} f(x) dx)²
      where f★f(t) = ∫ f(t-x)f(x) dx is the autoconvolution.
      
      Current best known bounds:
      * literature: 1.28 ≤ C1 ≤ 1.5098
      * alphaevolve: C1 ≤ 1.5052939684401607
      Goal: Beat the current upper bound of 1.5052939684401607 discovered by step functions and alphaevolve.
      
      Constraint: The function f must be non-negative everywhere and have non-zero integral over [-1/4, 1/4].
      
      MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:
      Given: Discretized domain [-1/4, 1/4] with n_points equally-spaced grid points.
      Objective: Minimize min_{t∈[-1/2,1/2]} (f★f)(t) / (∫f dx)² over all non-negative functions f.
      Discretization: Use finite differences and discrete convolution to approximate integrals and autoconvolution.

      PERFORMANCE METRICS:
      combined_score: The 1.5052939684401607/C1 constant achieved by the discovered function (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - maximize this)
      c1: constant achieved (current best upper bound)
      eval_time: Time to reach best solution
      n_points: number of points used in the integral interval
      loss: loss valued of the function used in minimization
      
      VALIDATION FRAMEWORK:
      Mathematical Validation: Verify the C1 computation using independent numerical integration
      Non-negativity Check: Ensure f(x) ≥ 0 everywhere (up to numerical tolerance)
      Integral Verification: Confirm ∫f dx > 0 to avoid degenerate solutions
      Consistency Check: Re-compute autoconvolution and verify inequality holds
      
      TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
      Reproducibility: Control random seeds for deterministic results
      Numerical Stability: Handle potential division by zero in integral ratios
      Memory Management: Discrete convolution can be memory-intensive for large grids
      Constraint Handling: Maintain non-negativity throughout optimization
      
      SUCCESS CRITERIA:
      Primary: Achieving c1 < 1.5052939684401607 (beating current record)
      Secondary: Finding interpretable functions that achieve high C1 values
      Robustness: Solutions that work across multiple runs and parameter settings
      Efficiency: Fast convergence to high-quality solutions
